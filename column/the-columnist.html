				<h2>The Columnist</h2>
				
				<h3 class="date">September 2, 2013</h3>

				<div class="post">

<p>When my kindergarten teacher asked, “What do you want to be when you grow up?” my friends would say, “An astronaut!” “A firefighter!” Well I wanted to be a columnist.</p>

<p>As I grew older, my dream became more of a reality. I traveled to the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=roman+colosseum&amp;data=!1m8!1m3!1d3!2d12.492633!3d41.891057!2m2!1f201.36!2f120.46!4f90!2m5!1e4!2m3!1s6246766362413951029!2e3!7e9!4m11!1m10!4m8!1m3!1d97183!2d-79.9805005!3d40.4313684!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!17b1&amp;fid=6" target="_blank">Roman Colosseum</a> to study their world-famous columns. Some people call that studying architecture, but I call it being a columnist.</p>

<p>I visited New York City to practice writing columns. Columns in buildings, columns in alleyways; I wrote on any column I could find. Some people consider that graffiti, but I consider it real-world experience.</p>

<p>For more real-world experience, I would go to my local newsstand and pick up the <em>New York Times</em>. I rapidly flipped through the pages to my favorite part of the newspaper – the columnist section. I crossed out the existing columns in red cherry-scented marker and wrote my own columns next to them. Then, I placed the newspaper back on the stand. Publicity is key for an amateur columnist to become a renowned, but still amateur, columnist.</p>

<p>I knew it was my destiny to become a columnist but not everyone agreed. My mom thought I lacked the charisma. Every night after she read me a bedtime story, she would whisper in my ear, “Dustin, you’re never going to be a columnist.” Well guess what mom; I’m doing it right now.</p>

<p>But that’s not enough. I want – no – I need to be famous. I will be the first columnist with a Justin Bieber caliber of fame. I have it all planned out. The first part of my plan is to write a column about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/kffacxfA7G4" target="_blank">babies and have Ludacris as a guest writer</a>. The second is to start dating <a href="http://selena-is-a-goddess.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Selena Gomez</a>. Well I don’t know if Justin and Selena are still dating. They have been on and off for the past couple of months. Of course I prefer to be on Selena Gomez rather than off her. And the third part is to uh… I haven’t planned that far ahead yet. But you know what they say: today is the tomorrow we worried about yesterday. Basically, I should start worrying about what’s happening right now.</p>

<p>Like what do columnists wear, a plaid button-down shirt with jeans? Do columnists even wear clothes? What will my friends think when they find out I’m a columnist? Do girls find columnists attractive or is that just me? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_a_tree_falls_in_a_forest" target="_blank">If no one reads my column, then did I ever write one?</a> And what is dustinalper.com? (cue in smooth transition explaining dustinalper.com)</p>

<p>For those of you who don’t know, during my senior year I was the columnist for my <a href="http://theydonthaveawebsite.com/" target="_blank">high school newspaper</a>. After I graduated, I had a dark void in my soul. Something was missing. It was me being a columnist. So I decided to start dustinalper.com, where I’m going to first share my original (but remastered) columns and then I’ll start sharing new columns once a month. What do you mean by remastered? Good question. I’m going to re-edit and add new jokes/ideas to my old columns.  I am also going to add hidden links, like this <a href="http://www.ifnoyes.com/" target="_blank">one</a>, to help you better understand references that I make in my columns.</p>

<p>If there are any new readers, I want to let you guys know off the bat that my writing style tends to be very sarcastic – no that wan’t sarcasm. If you enjoyed this column you can subscribe via email in the “Subscribe via Email” section down below. Lastly, I have to talk about this so there are no copyright issues. I don’t know if you could tell, but my website is based off <a href="http://perezhilton.com/" target="_blank">Perez Hilton’s</a>. We both have our name in the URL. We both write about pointless topics. The only difference is that my website has a little less pink. No but seriously, the real difference between Perez Hilton and myself is that he is a blogger and I am the columnist.</p>

<p>P.S. I recorded myself reading the column in case you are too lazy to read it yourself. But assuming that you just read through the column, I am probably telling you this too late. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/v/VK9pi-XsV0M" target="_blank">Whoopsie doodle.</a></p>
